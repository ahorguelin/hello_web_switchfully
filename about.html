                <p>I love computers and I love building them. I really enjoy to learn more about hardware of those
                    machines
                    that we use everyday. I recently made the jump to Linux to better understand the software side of
                    things
                    as well! I can't manage cables to save my life though.</p>

                <h2>DnD</h2>
                <p>After spending way too much time on Baldur's Gate 3, I recently started playing table top RPGs as
                    well.
                    The feeling of going on adventures with friend is really fun. I encourages people to look at unusual
                    situations under unusual angles.</p>

                <p>I love to cook and to learn more about cooking. My favorite dishes to make always involve bread.
                    Bread is
                    probably the more mathy food you can make. Once you understand baker's percentages, you can do
                    whatever
                    you want!</p>

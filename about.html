                <p>Hello, I'm Antoine!</p>
                <p>I studied marketing and worked as a technical consultant until I realized It was not the path I
                    wanted my career to take.</p>
                <p> I decided to take the leap last year and started learning computer science and programming online. I
                    fell in love with the craft and look forward to improve!</p>

                    <h2>Computers</h2>
                    <p>I love computers and I love building them. I really enjoy learning more about hardware of those
                        machines
                        we use everyday.
                    <p>I recently made the jump to linux to better understand the software side of things as well!</p>
                    <p>Here is the latest tower I built, duck for scale. I can't manage cables to save my life though.

                    <h2>DnD</h2>
                    <p>After spending way too much time on Baldur's Gate 3, I recently started playing table top RPGs as
                        well.
                    <p>The feeling of going on adventures with friends is really fun. It encourages people to look at
                        unusual situations under unusual angles.</p>
